            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Sweden history dates back to prehistoric times, but it gained prominence during the Viking Age (8th 11th centuries). In the Middle Ages, it was part of the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Norway. Sweden became a major European power in the 17th century during the reign of King Gustavus Adolphus. It remained neutral during both World Wars, which helped preserve its infrastructure and economy. Sweden is known for its long-standing tradition of peace, democracy, and humanitarian values.</p>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Swedish culture emphasizes equality, sustainability, design, and social welfare. The concept of “lagom” (meaning “just the right amount”) influences everything from work-life balance to food and fashion. Sweden is a hub for music, literature, and design—home to ABBA, IKEA, and Nobel laureates like Selma Lagerlöf. Celebrations like Midsummer, Lucia Day, and Walpurgis Night are culturally significant.</p>

            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Sweden is a secular country, though historically Lutheran Christianity has been dominant. The Church of Sweden (Evangelical Lutheran) was the state church until 2000. Today, many Swedes identify as non-religious, but religious freedom is respected and other religions like Islam, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Judaism are practiced.</p>
