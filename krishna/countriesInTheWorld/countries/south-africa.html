    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>South Africa has a rich and complex history. It was originally inhabited by indigenous groups like the San and Khoikhoi, followed by Bantu-speaking peoples. European colonization began with the Dutch in the 1600s, and later the British. The country suffered under racial segregation during apartheid (1948–1994), a system of institutionalized racism. Apartheid ended in 1994, when Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black president after democratic elections.</p>
